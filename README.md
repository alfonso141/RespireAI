# RespireAI

**RespireAI** is a machine learning-powered tool that analyzes environmental data (such as air quality, temperature, and humidity) to predict respiratory health risks, including asthma and COPD. By leveraging data science and predictive modeling, this project aims to provide early intervention solutions for healthcare and environmental monitoring systems.

## 🔍 Features
- Data ingestion and cleaning of multi-source air quality datasets
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of environmental trends
- Training machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict health risks
- Visualizing prediction results for easy understanding
- Optional: Deployment via **Streamlit** for an interactive web-based interface

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- **Python** – Primary programming language
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data manipulation and processing
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning algorithms
- **Jupyter Notebooks** – Data exploration and experimentation
- Optional: **TensorFlow** for deep learning models, **Streamlit** for interactive web deployment
